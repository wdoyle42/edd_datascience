1. Create a regression that predicts reading scores as a function of SES, using the training data.
2. Report the RMSE from a validation of your model using the testing data. 
3. Add another covariate to your model from 1. 
4. Again report the RMSE from a validation of your model using the testing data. Did you model improve? By how much?
